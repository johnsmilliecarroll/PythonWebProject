This is a Python flask application that connects to a MySQL Database.
Modification of this project: https://github.com/YogoGit/Python-Web/tree/cookies

Installations:
% pip3 install Flask
% pip3 install mysql
% pip3 install mysql_connector_python

The program will attempt to create the database 'accountsdatabase' inside the SQL localhost,
if it doesn't already exist. Currently it logs in with root, using the terrible password
'password01.' For this program to work, you must change the mypassword field in SQLaccess.py
to whatever your password is for root.

How to Run:
% python3 app.py
In your browser, load the page at http://127.0.0.1:5000

Next Steps:
If I were to develop this more I would add a way to hash passwords so they aren't displayed
in the database as plain text. I would also probably store the session uuid in the database
instead of in a list.
